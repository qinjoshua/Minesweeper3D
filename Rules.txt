   a. Understanding the Board
       -Each square, or board are place directly above/below each other respectively.
         *Imagine a standard tic-tac-toe board. Now imagine multiple tic-tac-toe boards stacked on top of each other, aligned correctly, one on top of the other.
       -Each square has smaller squares inside them called “cells”.
   b. Understanding the Number
       -When a cell is clicked, a number will appear.
       -This number indicates how many cells adjacent to the cell the number is on has a mine.
       -Cells that get filled in gray mean there aren’t any mines adjacent to it, in other words, a zero..
       -Adjacent cells include diagonal, horizontal, and vertical to the cell, as well as diagonal, horizontal, and vertical cells in the board above and below.
       -What the numbers don’t tell you is which exact cell has mines are located, so you have use your head and use process of elimination to guess where the mines are!

       -When you right click on a cell, you will place a flag.
       -Flags are markings that don’t do anything, other than prevent you from clicking on the cell and revealing the number/mine.
       -When right clicked on a flag, you will place a question mark. The rules are flags apply to question marks.
